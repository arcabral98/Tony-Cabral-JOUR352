<h2>Experience</h2>

<h3>Staff Intern</h3>
<h4>College Park Here and Now</h4>
<h5>June 2021 – present</h5>

<p>As a staff intern, it is my responsibility to write two feature length stories for each summer issue of the monthly publication. This position requires me to take on assignments from my editor and report on the stories. After the critical reporting, I craft a full article that encapsulates the vision of both myself and the editor.</p>

<h3>Features Editor and Multi-media Director</h3>
<h4>The UMD Hare, Satire Magazine</h4>
<h5>January 2020 – Present</h5>

<p>As a features editor, I am in charge of developing and pitching ideas to a staff of writers on a bi-weekly basis. After reviewing and editing the work of my writers, I dispatch an image for the satirical work. This process ends with me publishing the work on our magazine’s website. As the multi-media director, I run the magazine’s Instagram and TikTok accounts, producing content on a near-daily basis. This role will be expanded in the 2021-2022 school year as I grow the magazine’s video and podcast department.</p>

<h3>Staff Writer</h3>
<h4>The Campus Trainer</h4>
<h5>October 2020- April 2021</h5>

<p>As a staff writer for a lifestyle publication, I took on assignments on a bi-weekly basis. These assignments would require me to interview at least two students and one expert on subject ranging from nutrition to fashion. After writing and sharing my article, three separate editors would revise my work before publication.</p>
